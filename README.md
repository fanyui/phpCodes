php programes

In Order to deploy the hope clinic project, you need to crate a database named hopedb 
also crate a user call homestead and give it a password 'laravel'.
Then you can run the artisan command php artisan migrate --seed to create the tables 
and seed them with test data that i provided. Then  you can now continure to modify the program in 
anyway you want to.
